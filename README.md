## the paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article
There is a lot of investment going into software engineering at the moment due to the increasing reliance on mobile technology, venture capital-backed start-ups, the growing complexity of technology, and emerging industries. The demand for skilled and qualified software engineers seems to have no end.

The article dives into the definition of software engineering and provides me an intro of available career options and possible workplaces. What seems interesting to me is that the author states that software engineers often work under stress and tight deadlines while physically in a comfortable and relaxing environment. The mental stress is also something I am worried about when I am considering my career path as a software developer.

"Software engineers have extensive knowledge of programming languages, software development, and computer operating systems, and they apply engineering principles to software creation." 
The article chose the wording "extensive" to describe the amount of knowledge a software engineer has to possess, which sounds scary. But considering the average salary of $93k and the job market expecting to grow by 31%, I wouldn't say this requirement is too much.
