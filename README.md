The article dives into the definition of software engineering and provides me an intro of available career options and possible workplaces. What seems interesting to me is that the author states that software engineers often work under stress and tight deadlines while physically in a comfortable and relaxing environment. The mental stress is also something I am worried about when I am considering my career path as a software developer.
